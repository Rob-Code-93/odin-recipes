            <h3>What is Lemon Drizzle Cake?</h3>
            <p1>Lemon Drizzle cake is a zesty tangy sponge cake made with lemons and topped with a lemon glaze.</p1>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>225g unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <Li>225g caster sugar</Li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
                <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>For the lemon glaze</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1½ lemons, juiced</li>
                <li>85g caster sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <H3>Steps</H3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
                <li>Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.</li>
                <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
                <li>Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
                <li>While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle.</li>
                <li>Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.</li>
                <li>Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.</li>
            </ol>
